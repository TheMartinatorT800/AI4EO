# Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

Applying machine learning models to full-sized images presents unique challenges, particularly in segmentation, classification, and object detection. This project provides a structured approach to deploying trained models such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, and Random Forest classifiers on entire images or specific regions.

By leveraging deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques, this project enables efficient image processing for applications such as environmental monitoring, medical imaging, and remote sensing. The workflow includes preprocessing and data preparation, model loading and inference, full image rollout, and region-based processing.

## Introduction to K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm for partitioning data into distinct groups. The number of clusters (k) is pre-defined, and the algorithm assigns each data point to the nearest centroid.

Key Components of K-means

Choosing K: The number of clusters must be specified before running the algorithm.

Centroid Initialization: The algorithm starts with initial centroids that may affect the final results.

Assignment Step: Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid.

Update Step: Centroids are adjusted based on the mean of assigned points.

This iterative process continues until the centroids stabilize, ensuring that within-cluster variation is minimized.

## Advantages of K-means

**Efficiency**: K-means is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets.

**Ease of Interpretation**: The clustering results are straightforward to analyze and understand.

## Introduction to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) represent data as a combination of multiple Gaussian distributions. Unlike K-means, which assigns each data point to a single cluster, GMM provides probabilistic cluster assignments.

## Why Use Gaussian Mixture Models?

**Soft Clustering**: GMM offers a probability distribution for each data point rather than a hard assignment.

**Flexible Cluster Covariance**: Allows for clusters of different sizes and shapes.

## Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm in GMM

The EM algorithm refines the parameters of GMM iteratively:

**Expectation Step (E-step)**: Computes the probability of each data point belonging to a cluster.

**Maximization Step (M-step)**: Updates the Gaussian parameters to maximize the likelihood of the data.

This iterative approach continues until the parameters converge to stable values.

## Advantages of GMM

**Soft Clustering**: Provides a probabilistic framework for data classification.

**Cluster Shape Flexibility**: Adapts to various cluster structures.
